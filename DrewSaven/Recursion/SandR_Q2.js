//first we need to figure out how to input a tree

//We will need to scan through the different nodes of the tree to figure out
// which nodes have children.  

//Make sure that a node has no more than 2 kids
//report the degree of the tree. (we could do this a  number of ways--
//for instance, we could keep track of how many levels we go in a separate
//array, and ultimately report back the length of the array.
